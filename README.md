Create SPA: React + Typescript + Parcel
---------------------------------------
I was about to start yet another personal project, it consists of a SPA (Single Page Application) for a travel journal. 

Some time ago a tried Parcel, I really loved its simplicity for starting a simple project from scratch using Typescript + React stack, so I've decided to create this template project, so next time I want to start a new SPA with my favorite frontend stack, I will only have to clone https://github.com/carlosvin/react-typescript-parcel-template.git.
